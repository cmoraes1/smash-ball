# About: #
Large red balls spawn move towards the user's device from all directions. The user begins with 10 lives and each time a ball hits them they lose a life. There are 4 types of power ups that fall directly towards the ground which can improve the user's performance by doubling their score, giving them an extra life, freezing the balls for 10 seconds, and giving them a 5 point bonus. Power ups disappear from the screen once they reach a certain height so users only have a limited amount of time to acquire them. When the user loses all 10 lives, the game ends and he/she can submit their score to the rankings.
