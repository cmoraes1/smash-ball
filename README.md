# About: #
Large red objects move towards the users devices from all directions. Users begins with 10 lives and each time an objects hits them they lose a life. There are 4 types of power ups that fall directly towards the ground which can improve users performance by doubling their score, giving them an extra life, freezing the balls for 10 seconds, or giving them a 5 point bonus. Power ups disappear from the screen once they reach a certain height so users only have a limited amount of time to acquire them. When users lose all 10 lives, the game ends and they can submit their score to the rankings.
